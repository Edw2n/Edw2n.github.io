      value: "I have extensive experience in data-driven AI, focusing on high-quality data acquisition through sensor control. I collected new datasets (ImageNet-ES: 202K, ImageNet-ES-Natural: 115.2K) to address robustness and covariate shift issues. Proficient in domain adaptation, out-of-distribution detection, explainable AI, and model robustness, I have completed multiple projects and courses, served as a TA, and received several AI-related awards. My interests include Virtual Try-On, Accessibility, and Health applications."
