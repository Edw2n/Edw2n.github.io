#### [Key Concept]
In server offloading scenarios for deep learning services, privacy threats are a significant concern. This project aims to address these challenges by designing and developing a homomorphic encryption system. This system securely encrypts sensitive data and performs computations on the encrypted data within resource-rich GPU environments. The result is an efficient and secure solution that guarantees robust privacy protection.
