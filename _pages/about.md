<!-- I'm **Eunsu Baek**, a Ph.D. student at the AIoT Lab, Seoul National University, advised by Prof. Hyung-Sin Kim. Previously, I completed my Master's degree at HCIL Lab, Seoul National University,  focusing on HCI and visualization under the guidance of Prof. Jinuk Seo. 

My current research focuses on making AI practical and responsible, with interests in Embodied AI, Adaptive Sensing for DNNs, OOD problems, domain adaptation, and generalization. Recently, I've been working on new sensing techniques for deep neural networks that enable clear vision, similar to how corrective glasses work.

Hi, I’m **Eunsu Baek** — a Ph.D. student at the **Graduate School of Data Science**, *Seoul National University*, advised by **Prof. Hyung-Sin Kim**. I previously earned my Master’s in **HCI** and **visualization** at *HCIL Lab* under **Prof. Jinuk Seo**.

<!-- #Ressearch Interests: Make AI more **robust**, **reliable**, and **embodied**:
**Adaptive Sensing for DNNs**, **Domain adaptation & generalization**, **Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection**

I develop **sensing-centric methods** that enhance robustness not only through model training, but also by optimizing **data acquisition** and **system-level design**—much like how **corrective lenses** improve human vision.

Thanks for visiting — feel free to explore or [connect with me](mailto:beshu9407@snu.ac.kr)! -->
