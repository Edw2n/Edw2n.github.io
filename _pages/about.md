Hi there! I'm Eunsu Baek, a Ph.D. student at the AIoT Lab, Seoul National University, advised by Prof. Hyung-Sin Kim. Previously, I completed my Master's degree at HCIL Lab, Seoul National University,  focusing on HCI and visualization under the guidance of Prof. Jinuk Seo. 

My current research focuses on making AI practical and responsible, with interests in Edge AI, OOD problems, domain adaptation, and generalization. Recently, I've been working on new sensing techniques for deep neural networks that enable clear vision, similar to how corrective glasses work.

Feel free to explore and connect. Enjoy your visit!
